All of this work occurs on the VM: http://www.cloudera.com/content/support/en/downloads/download-components/download-products.html?productID=F6mO278Rvo

First download Spring's Tool Suite, it is just convenient and hasn't yelled at me while using the VM.

http://spring.io/tools/sts/all - I'm using 'Based on Eclipse 4.3.2' for Linux, 64-bit. Shell/tarball preference
is up to you.

Install it.

Clone our repository to your home directory/workspace.

Open up the Spring version of Eclipse that we downloaded. Import --> Maven --> Existing --> Root = wherever you put the repository

Ok... Project is in... Let's configure Hadoop so you can get some data.

Run the following commands from the Terminal:
$ sudo su hdfs
$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera
$ hadoop fs -chown cloudera /user/cloudera
$ exit
$ sudo su cloudera
$ hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/wordcount /user/cloudera/wordcount/970
$ echo "Hello World Bye World" > file0
$ echo "Hello Hadoop Goodbye Hadoop" > file1
$ hadoop fs -put file* /user/cloudera/wordcount/970

Ok, now the data is loaded.

Go back to Eclipse, right click on the project and Run On Server.

Either it will pop into Firefox or load it in Eclipse in their web browser. You should try to open it in Firefox. Just
ping http://localhost:8080/idealspreadsheet/ to get the homepage. http://localhost:8080/idealspreadsheet/wordcount?id=970
to run the job on that collection.
